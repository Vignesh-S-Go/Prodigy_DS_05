# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship — Task 05

## 📄 Task Overview
**Task 05:**  
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

**Dataset Used:**  
[US Accident Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda)

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains records of traffic accidents with details such as:
- **Time of accident**
- **Day of week**
- **Driver demographics:** Age band, sex, education level, driving experience
- **Vehicle details:** Type, ownership, service year
- **Accident causes and severity**
- **Road and environmental conditions**

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

### ✔️ Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values and cleaned the dataset.
- Converted time columns to hours for time-based analysis.

---

### ✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Accident Severity Distribution:** Checked how accidents are distributed across severity levels.
- **Accidents by Day of the Week:** Identified peak days for accidents.
- **Accidents by Time of Day:** Found the most dangerous hours (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
- **Causes of Accidents:** Listed top contributing factors like overtaking, lane changes, speeding, etc.
- **Driver Analysis:** Explored age band, sex, and driving experience impact on accident severity.

---

### ✔️ Visualizations
- **Bar Charts:** For day of the week, cause of accident, age bands, and driving experience.
- **Histograms:** Distribution of accidents by hour of the day.
- **Heatmaps (optional):** If location data is present, accident hotspots can be visualized.

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Most accidents occur during **peak traffic hours** (morning and evening).
- **Inexperienced and very old drivers** are involved in higher severity accidents.
- **Weekends or specific weekdays** show increased accident counts.
- **Top causes:** Lane changing, following too closely, speeding, and driver distraction.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into patterns and trends in traffic accidents. It helps authorities and policymakers to:
- Implement targeted safety measures.
- Improve road designs.
- Raise awareness about risky behaviors based on demographics and time patterns.
